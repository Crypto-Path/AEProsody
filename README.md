# Prosody
A web rhythm game similar to games like osu!mania, etterna, and stepmania. Plans to have a bunch of features including poerting maps from other games, playing maps uploaded to a server (Certain ones being rank) and being able to play ranked ones for value (similar to osu!pp). Eventually accounts and profile information and leaderboards for maps. </br>
